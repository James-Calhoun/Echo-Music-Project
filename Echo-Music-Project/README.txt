This is Echo Music, my solo project for Coding Dojo (version 1, phase 1)

My stack for this project is Python, Flask, and MySQL. 

Future features that will be implemented are: 
-Spotipy API integration
-Creating your own playlists 
-Adding a favorite song to your page for people to listen to (Myspace nostalgia </3)
-Sending/Receiving friend requests
-Like/Comment/Echo other user's posts

and many more!
